# Publishing your software

Website: [https://dicook.github.io/tutorial_publishing_your_software/](https://dicook.github.io/tutorial_publishing_your_software/)

This tutorial is for data analysts and statisticians who work regularly write 
software in their research. It will describe approaches for writing a publication 
focused on describing the software. This content will primarily focus on R software, 
but the approaches would be similar to other software written in other languages.  
There will be an opportunity to show your own software and get advice on how to write it up. 

**Presenter**: [Dianne Cook](https://www.dicook.org), a Professor of 
Statistics at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, is a global leader
in data visualisation. She has delivered over 100 invited talks 
internationally and published extensively on various aspects of data 
visualisation. Dr. Cook is a Fellow of the American Statistical 
Association, an elected member of the International Statistical 
Institute, past editor of the Journal of Computational and Graphical 
Statistics, and the R Journal. She has served as a Board Member of the 
R Foundation and is currently the co-chair of the Statistical Computing 
and Visualisation Section of the [Statistical Society of Australia](https://www.statsoc.org.au).

**Presenter**: [Fonti Kar](https://fontikar.github.io)

**Background**: You should have a basic understanding of R, be familiar 
with [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz). Ideally, you have packaged code and made it 
available on a public archive such as [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org). This would be a good 
tutorial for research students to join. 

## Structure of tutorial

Session 1:

    - Comparison of common outlets for publishing software: Journal of Statistical Software, the R Journal, Journal of Open Source Software, Methods of Ecology and Evolution, Genome Biology
    - Structure and purpose of a software article:
        - What is original?
        - Why is this different from just supplementary material?
        - Motivation: why did you write the software? What is special and why others should use it? Why existing tools don't do the job? Putting your work in the context of existing software
        - Examples/applications/speed comparisons/benchmarking
        - Workflow diagrams
        - Overview of functions/bones of the software

Session 2: 

    - Review some examples of published software: good and bad examples
    - Open source practices: version control, zenodo/DOI, GitHub releases
    - Share and discuss your own software
