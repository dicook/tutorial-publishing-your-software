This tutorial is for data analysts and statisticians who work regularly write 
software in their research. It will describe approaches for writing a publication 
focused on describing the software. This content will primarily focus on R software, 
but the approaches would be similar to other software written in other languages.  There will be an opportunity to show your own software 
and get advice on how to write it up.
