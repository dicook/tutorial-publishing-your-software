# Publishing your software

Website: [https://dicook.github.io/tutorial_publishing_your_software/](https://dicook.github.io/tutorial_publishing_your_software/)

This tutorial is for data analysts and statisticians who work regularly write 
software in their research. It will describe approaches for writing a publication 
focused on describing the software. This content will primarily focus on R software, 
but the approaches would be similar to other software written in other languages. 
There will group activities and individual activities to help you get started with
writing an article on your own software. 

**Presenter**: [Dianne Cook](https://www.dicook.org), a Professor of 
Statistics at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, is a global leader
in data visualisation. She has delivered over 100 invited talks 
internationally and published extensively on various aspects of data 
visualisation. Dr. Cook is a Fellow of the American Statistical 
Association, an elected member of the International Statistical 
Institute, past editor of the Journal of Computational and Graphical 
Statistics, and the R Journal. She has served as a Board Member of the 
R Foundation and is currently the co-chair of the Statistical Computing 
and Visualisation Section of the [Statistical Society of Australia](https://www.statsoc.org.au).

**Presenter**: [Fonti Kar](https://fontikar.github.io)

**Background**: You should have a basic understanding of R, be familiar 
with [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz). Ideally, you have packaged code and made it 
available on a public archive such as [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org). This would be a good 
tutorial for research students to join. 

## Structure of tutorial

Session 1: Where, why, how
    - Setting the scene: Why publish software as an article?
        - Value of software papers in academic careers (citations, recognition, tenure/promotion)
        - Benefits for the community (visibility, credibility, discoverability).
        - Why is a paper better than supplementary material for a regular paper?
        - Common outlets for publishing software: 
            - Journal of Statistical Software 
            - the R Journal 
            - Journal of Open Source Software 
            - Methods of Ecology and Evolution 
            - Genome Biology 
            - Similarities and differences and metrics
            - Review criteria
    - Writing the article
        - Problem statement and motivation: why did you write the software? What is special and why others should use it? Why existing tools don't do the job? Putting your work in the context of existing software
        - Key features of the software.
        - Design/implementation details.
        - Examples/use cases/applications/speed comparisons/benchmarking
        - Handling big data, or private data.
        - Handling slow computation/reproducibility.
        - Add a workflow diagram?
        - Tips for figures.
        - Reproducibility of your article.
        - Writing a cover letter.
  
Session 2: Start preparing
    - Small group activity: Review some examples of articles of published software
        - Structure
        - Motivation
        - Functionality
        - Usefulness in getting started
    - Preparing Your Software for Publication
        - Open source practices
        - Minimum standards: clear documentation, license, installation instructions.
        - Tests and reproducibility: automated testing, example datasets, vignettes/tutorials.
        - Version control, zenodo/DOI, GitHub releases
        - Writing a good README
        - The submission process (journal-specific requirements)
        - Responding to reviewer commentsâ€”common issues (docs not clear, lack of tests).
    - Hands-on activity: 
        - Draft a short abstract for your own software.
        - Sketch an outline for an article on your own software.
        - Identify a target journal.
